# from numpy import * doesn't overwrite these builtin names

# These imports may overwrite names from the import * above.

# Don't know why, but we have to do an absolute import to import linalg. If we
# instead do
#
# from . import linalg
#
# It doesn't overwrite np.linalg from above. The import is generated
# dynamically so that the library can be vendored.
